## Question 1
Write a Python program that allows the user to enter a series of numbers.

The input process should stop when a `non-positive` number is entered, and `duplicate numbers should not be accepted`.

Finally, the program should display all `unique pairs` of numbers as `tuples`.



## Question 2
Write the output of the following program:

```python
text = "         You must get at least {:.1f} in that course.       ".format(3.25)
print(text)
text = text.strip()
print(text)
text = text.replace(“must", “should")
print(text)
text = text.title()
print(text)
print (text[15:5:-1])
```
